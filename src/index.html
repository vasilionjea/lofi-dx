      <p>Yosemite National Park is an American national park in California, surrounded on the southeast by Sierra
        National Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest. The park is managed by the National Park
        Service and covers an area of 759,620 acres and sits in four counties &mdash; centered in Tuolumne and Mariposa,
        extending north and east to Mono and south to Madera County.</p>
      <p>Rock climbing is an important part of Yosemite. In particular Yosemite Valley, which is surrounded by famous
        summits like Half Dome and El Capitan. Camp 4, a walk-in campground in the Valley, was instrumental in the
        development of rock climbing as a sport, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Climbers can
        generally be spotted in the snow-free months on anything from ten-foot-high boulders to the 3,300-foot (1.0 km)
        face of El Capitan. Classes on rock climbing are offered by numerous groups.</p>
